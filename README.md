PROJECT REPORT

1.	INTRODUCTION

1.1	Project Overview

It is essential to diagnose liver disease early in order to save lives and take the necessary steps to control the condition. The ensemble approach has been successfully used in a number of sectors, particularly in the field of medical science. This study examines the early diagnosis of liver illness using a variety of ensemble methodologies.

1.2	Purpose

Our project's objective is to analyze data from liver patients with a focus on the correlations between a vital list of liver enzymes, proteins, age and gender using them to try and predict the likeliness of liver disease. We are creating a model in this instance by utilizing different machine learning algorithms to identify the most accurate model. and incorporate into web applications built with flask. By entering certain parameters into the web application, users can predict the disease.


2.	LITERATURE SURVEY

2.1	Existing problem

The liver related diseases are identified by analyzing liver function blood test reports and scan reports. This paper while employing different data mining algorithms to ease this process, it is possible to reduce the time for diagnosing the liver disease.
But it doesn’t assist in making effective decisions and some accuracy Issues.

AUTHOR: Varun Vats
YEAR: 2018
He considered three different ML (Machine Learning) algorithms. A comparison of these algorithms had been carried out for evaluating their forecasting accuracy and computing intricacy . These algorithms included AP (Affinity Propagation), K means and DBSCAN. This work was dedicated to the
 
medical dataset based on lever disorders. This work made use of the Silhouette coefficient to measure the comparative efficiency of the considered algorithmic approaches.

AUTHOR: Vyshali J Gogi
YEAR : 2018
He stated that the healthcare sector had a lot of data but this data was of no use [17]. This ample data required a leading analytic tool so that the hidden relationship and the valuable knowledge could be determined. The liver disease referred to the medical condition of the human liver-related to the human liver. The liver diseases led to sudden changes in health conditions that governed the functioning of the liver affecting other internal body organs. This work made use of several classification algorithms based on data mining. These algorithms included DT (Decision Tree), LD (Linear Discriminant), SVM Fine Gaussian, and LR (Logistic Regression). This work made use of Lab-based metrics of patients in the form of a liver dataset.

AUTHOR: Auxilia
YEAR: 2018
She stated that the use of medical datasets had attracted the medical experts globally [18]. The use of ML (Machine Learning) algorithms was quite common as a branch of making selection expressively helpful networks for the prediction of diseases by arranging therapy-based datasets. Grouping schemes had been generally employed as a segment of the curative domain for extracting order more efficiently as compared to a signal classification model. The disorders of the Liver malady could be described as liver damage or sickness. Liver disorder can be categorized into several categories. This work made use of standard Indian liver illness patient records as a database for providing support to the researcher

AUTHOR: Pushpendra Kumar
YEAR: 2019
He stated that it was a very difficult task for the doctors to detect the consequences of liver disorders on a person . In general, researchers used datasets based on LFT (Liver Function Test) for implementing classification algorithms so that the predictions about liver disorders could be generated. The dataset based on ground truth had several problems such as a class imbalance in the liver disorder data. With regard to the majority classes, the classic algorithms of classification generated influenced outcomes. This work presented a new Fuzzy-ANWKNN algorithm for the successful prediction of liver disorder.
 
5.	TITLE: “To accurately predict liver disorder by means of several data mining algorithms”

YEAR: 2018
He described different classification approaches by implementing them on the dataset of patients suffering from liver diseases . The main objective here was to accurately predict liver disorder by means of several data mining algorithms. This work performed the analysis using the dataset of real-time patients to build classification paradigms for the prediction of liver diseases. This work implemented five classification algorithms on the used dataset.
This work analyzed different metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy for determining the efficiency of the implemented classification models.


2.3	:Problem Statement Definition

The main objective of this project is to analyze the parameters of various classification algorithms and compare their predictive accuracies so as to find out the best classifier for determining the liver disease. Here we are building a model by applying various machine learning algorithms to find the best accurate model and integrate it to a flask-based web application. User can predict the disease by entering parameters in the web application. ML algorithms are new techniques to handle many hidden problems in medical data sets. This approach can help healthcare management and professionals to explore better results in numerous clinical applications, such as medical image processing, language processing, and tumor or cancer cell detection, by finding appropriate features.
